# Interactive visualization dashboard in Python with Panel

In this project, I want to explore the panel package in python and make a interactive dashboard about world population. 

Learning what widget and pipeline objects are and how to create them.

Learning how to create tables and plots which can reflect changes from wodgets.

(Widgets - Interactive Pipeline - Dataframe) 

The source data is obtained from the world data bank, which contains country population from 1960 to 2021.
